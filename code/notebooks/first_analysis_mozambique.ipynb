      "\"the summit to demonstrate the benefits of climate action and how everyone can benefit”. In his view, a growing number of governments, cities and businesses already understand that climate solutions can strengthen our economies, improve air quality and public health and protect our environment.  This will involve a commitment to enhancing national pledges contained in the Paris Agreement by 2020, Guterres explained, and countries “showing how we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent over the next decade and get to net zero emissions globally by 2050”.  Assessing the potential benefits of sustainably-driven climate solutions that leave no-one behind, the UN Secretary-General welcomed the “growing number of governments, cities and businesses” that had embraced Agenda 2030-inspired climate solutions as a way to “strengthen our economies, improve air quality and public health and protect our environment”.  Initiatives could come from a range of areas, “such as energy, sustainable agriculture, forests and oceans and resilience to climate impacts”, Guterres said, maintaining that renewable technologies “are already delivering energy at a lower cost than the fossil-fuel driven economy”.  Despite this progress, much more radical steps must be taken, he insisted, explaining that “this means ending subsidies for fossil fuels and high-emitting, unsustainable agriculture, and shifting towards renewable energy, electric vehicles and climate-smart practices”.  In addition, “it means carbon pricing that reflects the true cost of emissions, from climate risk to the health hazards of air pollution”, the UN chief explained, “and it means accelerating the closure of coal plants, halting plans for new ones, and replacing those jobs with healthier alternatives, so the transformation is just, inclusive and profitable.”  President of the General Assembly, Maria Fernanda Espinosa, said she had pledged throughout her time in office there was a need for “a holistic understanding of the socio-economic consequences of increasingly intense extreme weather on countries around the world”, adding that the report “makes an important contribution to our combined international action to focus attention on this very critical problem.”  It was “really not good news” she told journalists, that CO2 emissions had jumped from 1.6 per cent in 2017, to passing the 2.7 per cent emissions growth, during 2018.  “We need to act, and to act now. The numbers and data are extremely worrisome…We are capable, we have the science, we have the knowledge, we have the tools in hand” to push back on global warming, she added.  WMO said that the temperature rise last year, came despite the agreement by the international community in December 2015 in Paris, to curb carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, and to limit global temperature rise to well below 2C.  “The time remaining to achieve commitments under the Paris Agreement is quickly running out,” said WMO Secretary-General, Petteri Taalas. Outlining the report’s key findings, Professor Taalas warned of record greenhouse gas concentrations last year, that drove global temperatures towards increasingly dangerous levels.  According to WMO, carbon dioxide levels were at 357 parts per million (ppm) in 1994, rising to 405.5 ppm in 2017.  Professor Taalas also described “striking” evidence of record warming from 2015 to 2018, increasing sea-level rise and the loss of sea ice in both northern and southern polar regions.  Noting that extreme weather events have continued into 2019 - most recently with Tropical Cyclone Idai, which caused devastating floods and loss of life in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi – Professor Taalas said that its victims “personify why we need the global agenda on sustainable development, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction”.  According to WMO, the start of this year has also seen warm record daily winter temperatures in Europe, unusual cold in North America and searing heatwaves in Australia. The extent of ice in the Arctic and Antarctica is yet again well below average, it said.  From now until May, WMO also forecasts above-average sea surface temperatures, which are expected to lead to above-normal land temperature, particularly in tropical latitudes.  Earlier on March 28, the General Assembly held a High-Level meeting on climate change and sustainable development, including panel discussions on synergies between the two, and how the two agendas can be brought together in terms of concrete action.  \"\n",

Ramaphosa has ruled out the possibility of privatizing Eskom that has long been hampered by alleged corruption and poor management.  Eskom is facing debts amounting to 420 billion rand (about 30 billion U.S. dollars).  The utility has urgently appealed to the government to help it repay the debt so as to prevent it from bankruptcy.  Eskom has been accused of using load shedding to blackmail the government, but the utility has denied the allegation, saying the recent load shedding was caused by the breakdown of several power stations.  Previous attempts by the government to bail out embattled Eskom have failed.  On Wednesday, Minister of Finance Tito Mboweni confirmed in a letter to the DA that the National Treasury does not know how big the new proposed bailout to Eskom will be.  In his budget speech last month, the minister said that the government will bail out Eskom with 23 billion rand (about 160 million dollars) yearly over the next three years.  However, this bailout is now likely to increase given Eskom’s current situation, Mboweni said.  .

Load-shedding has has worsened since Saturday following the onslaught of tropical cyclone Idai in Mozambique.  A loss of 1,100 megawatts from Mozambique forced Eskom to implement stage 4 load-shedding, which allows for up to 4000 MW of the national load to be shed.  Stage 4 is the most severe load-shedding that was first implemented in February and now has been in effect for the past five consecutive days.  There have been reports that Eskom is preparing stage 5 and 6 load-shedding, meaning that the utility will shed 5,000 MW and 6,000 MW respectively, seen as an indication that the national grid is on the brink of collapse.  South Africa has never experienced higher than stage 4 load-shedding.

Helicopters and boats have been carrying people to safety. The United Nations’ humanitarian office warned that more flooding may come as heavy rains inland poured into the low-lying Beira area and nearby dams filled up threatening to burst the Buzi and Pungwe rivers again. “We’re going to have to wait until the flood waters recede until we know the full expanse of the toll on the people of Mozambique,” said UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) coordinator Sebastian Rhodes Stampa.

With the flooding easing in parts of cyclone-stricken Mozambique on Friday, fears were rising that the waters could yield up many more bodies. Eight days after Cyclone Idai struck, the homeless, hungry and injured slowly made their way from devastated inland areas to the port city of Beira, which was heavily damaged itself but has emerged as the nerve centre for rescue efforts. “Some were wounded. Some were bleeding,” said Julia Castigo, a Beira resident who watched them arrive. “Some had feet white like flour for being in the water for so long.” Aid workers are seeing many children who have been separated from their parents in the chaos or orphaned. Elhadj As Sy, secretary-general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said the relief efforts so far “are nowhere near the scale and magnitude of the problem,” and the humanitarian needs are likely to grow in the coming weeks and months. “We should brace ourselves,” he said. Helicopters set off into the rain for another day of efforts to find people clinging to rooftops and trees.

However, the state attorney objected to the accused’s bail application, noting that the sureties did not submit letters from their LC1 chairpersons to confirm their places of abode.    The prosecutor also informed court that given the provisions of the Anti- Corruption Act, once investigations commence, interdiction follows. According to the prosecutor, the charge indicates that the accused is a resident of a Police barracks in Entebbe, yet his sureties said he resides in Naguru.    “At the moment, prosecution does not know where the accused will be staying after being released on bail,” Agaba said.    She said if court is inclined to release the accused on bail, it should impose stringent terms that will compel him to attend court. The magistrate subsequently declined to grant Kalete bail on grounds that the sureties were not substantial.    “Although it is the constitutional right of the accused to apply for bail, none of his sureties have submitted in court documents to show their places of abode,” he said.

It is at this site that the Isimba Hydropower Dam, the third largest electricity plant and one of the country’s biggest projects, has been taking shape.    Today, President Yoweri Museveni will commission the plant, one of the most important hydropower projects that the Ugandan Government has embarked on, to ease power shortages in the country and accelerate the development of the local economy.    The 183MW Isimba Hydropower project is 4km downstream of Isimba Falls on the River Nile and about 50km downstream from the source of the Nile. The project site is about 21km from Kayunga, the nearest town and about 65km from Jinja town. Isimba is expected to generate hydroelectric power at 68 cents per kilowatt, the lowest in East Africa.

New Vision's Gerald Tenywa:    Dry and hot conditions have prevailed over the country despite earlier predictions that the March-May rainy season would start in the last week of February. The intense heat, which started at the beginning of the year, has brought stress to many people.    “The rains recorded early this month had brought hope that this undesirable condition was coming to an end. However, a tropical cyclone that hit parts of Mozambique Channel (between Mozambique and Madagascar) has created areas of low pressure and this has disrupted the March-May rain season,” said James Bataze, a meteorologist at the Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA).    He added: “Dry conditions have prevailed over the country for the last three weeks, and this has disrupted the onset and performance of the March-April and May 2019 rainfall season.”    A statement by Festus Luboyera, the executive director of UNMA, said the disruption of the rain was caused by the tropical cyclone Idai.    Tropical cyclones are some of the weather systems generated over oceans. Luboyera said idai had diverted the rain-making winds from Uganda to the Mozambique Channel.    The tropical cyclone is expected to die down on Friday and Saturday.      #UgandaToday    ____________________________________    8:40am  Good morning        Meanwhile, a good morning to you all.

In Malawi, nearly a million people have been affected and more than 80,000 forced from their homes, according to the UN.

Electronic payments are not operational because the internet and mobile phone networks have collapsed.  The only place in the city that has electricity and internet is the operations centre at Beira's airport, where the Red Cross has set up a server with free internet for journalists.  The district of Buzi, 150km from Beira, is the most affected. There are people (on top of) the trees and the few remaining buildings. The entire district is submerged, and there are more than 10 000 (flood) victims. The Central Hospital, the province's main hospital, is operating at only 20% capacity. The roof of the mortuary building has collapsed, affecting the cold storage system. The supplies needed to fix the building can only come from Maputo, but the roads are cut off.  Beira today is a ghost of what it was just a week ago; destroyed, submerged and cut off from the rest of the world . The full scale of the tragedy is yet to be understood.
