The property was subsequently taken over by the government to ensure that jobs were secure and the property could be sold as quickly as possible.\\nIf a deal is reached with RCI, the company could receive the resort in a worsened state after the passage of Hurricane Dorian, though\\xa0Minister of Tourism and Aviation Dionisio D’Aguilar reported on Sunday that the\\xa0Grand Lucayan complex is completely insured in case of catastrophic loss.\\nD’Aguilar also added that Holistica’s redevelopment plans call for the partial demolition of the complex in any event.\\nBayley said in his statement that RCI is committed to the long-term success of The Bahamas’ tourism industry.\\n“While we are all focused on offering assistance with the hurricane recovery, we would like to assure the minister and people of The Bahamas that we remain committed to this project and to the long-term success of the Bahamian tourism industry,” said\\xa0Bayley.\\nRCI officially opened its “Perfect Day at Coco Cay” product recently on a private cay in the Berry Islands.\\nIn his statement, Donald restated Carnival’s commitment to both its Grand Bahama project and its proposed redevelopment of its private island Half Moon Cay.\\n“On behalf of all of us at Carnival Corporation and our cruise line brands, let me begin by saying our thoughts and prayers go out to the great people of The Bahamas — our friends and partners for many years,” he said.\\n“It was very emotional seeing reports of Hurricane Dorian’s impact over the past couple days. Our hearts go out to those who have lost friends and loved ones and whose homes and businesses have been destroyed or damaged.\\n“In recent weeks, there have been questions about our commitment to two major projects on the islands of Grand Bahama and Half Moon Cay. We remain fully committed to those projects as part of the recovery and rebuilding process.”\\n'"
